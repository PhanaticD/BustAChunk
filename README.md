# Bust a Chunk!

Built for FactionsUUID!

Place a Bust a Chunk! to destroy everything in a chunk below where you placed it! Don't worry, though, because you'll have plenty of time to get out of the chunk. Every ten layers, glass will replace the blocks as the Bust a Chunk! eats the blocks, so you and your friends can get out! A hologram will count down the ten seconds you have to leave before the glass goes away.
